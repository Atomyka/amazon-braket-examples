In this tutorial, we'll show how Aquila can prepare the simplest of such ordered phases, namely an antiferromagnetic phase (aka $\\mathbb{Z_2}$ phase) in both one- and two-dimensional arrays of atoms. To make this possible, we will make use of the [Rydberg blockade](https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/dev/tutorials/1.blockade/main/) - the mechanism at the heart of our quantum computing architecture."
