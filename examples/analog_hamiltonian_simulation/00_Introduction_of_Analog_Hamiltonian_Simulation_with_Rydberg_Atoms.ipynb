    "# Introduction of analog Hamiltonian simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS) is a different paradigm of quantum computing compared to the gate-based quantum computing. The idea of AHS is to use a well-controlled quantum system and engineer its interaction to mimic the dynamics of the Hamiltonian of the quantum system in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the gate-based quantum computation, the program is a quantum circuit consisting of a series of quantum gates, each of which acts only a small subset of qubits. In contrast, an AHS program is one or a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians that govern the time evolution of all the qubits. The comparison can be seen in the following figure (Source: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12326\">Henriet et al.</a>), where the left side shows a typical quantum circuit, and the right side illustrates that, during AHS, the effect of the evolution under a Hamiltonian can be understood as a unitary acting simultaneously on all qubits.\n",
