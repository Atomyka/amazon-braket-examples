After the initial state are two entanglement layers. The first layer entangles each qubit with its nearest neighbor, and the second layer with each qubit's third nearest neighbor. A rotation gate is then applied to the first qubit. Finally, the measurement is only done on the first qubit. The classification criterion is only based on this measurement.

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated a use case that requires Python packages not supported by any of the pre-configured containers provided by Braket Jobs. We have learned the steps to prepare a Dockerfile and build our own container that supports our use case. Using Braket Jobs with BYOC provides the flexibility of defining custom environments and the convenience of switching between environments for different applications."
